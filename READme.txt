Used a responsive layout, ensuring proper spacing and alignment for various screen sizes.

## Image Gallery:

Incorporated an image gallery with five images, each linked to a preview page.
Added a simple JavaScript function to navigate to the preview page when an image is clicked.

## Table with Data:

Designed a table displaying cake names, weights/quantities, and prices.
Provided relevant information for each cake product.

## Animation:

Included a simple animation, such as a burger menu animation for opening and closing.
Enhanced user experience with subtle transitions.
