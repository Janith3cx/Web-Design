Used a responsive layout, ensuring proper spacing and alignment for various screen sizes.
4. Image Gallery:
Incorporated an image gallery with five images, each linked to a preview page.
Added a simple JavaScript function to navigate to the preview page when an image is clicked.
5. Table with Data:
Designed a table displaying cake names, weights/quantities, and prices.
Provided relevant information for each cake product.
